Smile Detection with OpenCV

Overview
This project is a Python-based smile detection application that uses OpenCV to detect faces and smiles in real-time via a webcam. The program identifies faces and smiles, displaying a "smile score" whenever a smile is detected.

Features
Real-time face detection using Haar cascades.
Smile detection within detected faces.
Displays a randomly generated "smile score" when a smile is detected.
Simple and interactive UI using OpenCV's video display capabilities.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV

Installation
Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, download it from python.org.

Install OpenCV: Open a terminal and run the following command:


pip install opencv-python
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmileDetection.git
cd SmileDetection

Run the Program:

python smile_detection.py

Run the Script:

Execute the Python script smile_detection.py in your terminal or command prompt.
A window will open displaying your webcam feed.
Detect Smiles:

The script will detect faces in the video feed and attempt to identify smiles.
When a smile is detected, a "smile score" will be displayed on the screen.

Exit the Program:

To close the program, press the q key while the video window is in focus.

Customization
Cascade Files: The project uses pre-trained Haar cascades for face and smile detection. You can experiment with different cascades or adjust parameters like scaleFactor and minNeighbors in the code to improve detection accuracy.
